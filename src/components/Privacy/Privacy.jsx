        Like most website operators, Starial collects non-
        personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. Starial's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how Starial's visitors use its
        website. From time to time, Starial may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Starial also
        collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
        Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
        comments on https:// www.starial.in/blog posts. Starial only discloses
        logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances

        who leave a comment at https://www.starial.in/ to provide a username and
        email address.
