        <p>
          <br />
          <br />
          We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service
          immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole
          discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation,
          including but not limited to a breach of Terms. If you wish to
          terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service. All
          provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination
          shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
          provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
          liability.

        19. <b>Governing Law</b>
        <p>
          <br />
          <br />
          These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
          laws of India, which governing law applies to agreement without regard
          to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or
          provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
          rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
          unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will
          remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between
          us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior
          agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.

        20. <b>Changes To Service</b>
        <p>
          <br />
          <br />
          We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service
          or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without
          notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of
          Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to
          time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire
          Service, to users, including registered users.
          <br />
          <br />

        21.<b> Amendments To Terms</b>
        <p>
          <br />
          <br />
          We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this
          site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
          Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised
          Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected
          to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they
          are binding on you. By continuing to access or use our Service after
          any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised
          terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer
          authorized to use Service.
          <br />

        22. <b>Waiver And Severability</b>
        <p>
          <br />
          <br />
          No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall
          be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or
          a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to
          assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver
          of such right or provision. If any provision of Terms is held by a
          court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
          illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be
          eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining
          provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
